## Governing Strategy Tree  

### Application  

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)


### Trade-offs  

#### *Advantages*  
- Better than minimax for competitions against other people, especially for those that don't perform as well as the top staff teams, as they'll inevitably make some sub-optimal decisions that expectimax can take advantage of 

#### *Disadvantages*
- Requires completely manual tuning based on results and observations made from previous performance
- Expensive computations as there can't be any pruning done to the trees, needs to be carefully managed to avoid going over the turn time limit
