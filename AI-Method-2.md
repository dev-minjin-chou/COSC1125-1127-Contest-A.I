# Q-learning

## Governing Strategy Tree 

### Application  
Used this technique as the base agent instead of reflexCaptureAgent. Took advantage of the computeQValuesAction to further evaluate a better legal action based on q-values. Improved chooseAction function by implementing calculations of q-values. 

### Trade-offs  
Our agent is relatively smarter when we are using qlearning agents compared to expectimax agents however the trade-offs is qlearning agents are harder to implement and train. Switching out the evaluation function by using computeQValueActions shows a relatively different behaviour when we were using expectimax. Our pacman is more sensitive in detecting opponents however due to we are using approximateQLearning at times it is hard to train our agent as each maps ran are random. It would be more efficient if we were to switch to deepQLearning however due to time constraints we are unable to get it to work. 

#### *Advantages*  
- Doesn't require as much manual tuning as other methods, as the policies are formed from experience
- An advantage of approximate q-learning in particular, is that while q-learning learns the value of unique states through many iterations and experiences of being in that unique state, approximate q-learning can takes the elements of a state, compare it to a heuristic, and judge its value based on its experience using that particular heuristic, rather than its experience being in that unique state
  - This is especially useful for Pacman, as there's too many states for q-learning to reasonably learn all of their values. However, approximate q-learning is able to generalise states and their values, and apply similar values to states with similar outcomes, but with varying compositions

#### *Disadvantages*
- Difficult to train well using regular q-learning in a long Pacman competition, as the layouts used aren't always the same, and teams are continually changing and improving their strategies which requires more learning
- Diversity of competition opponents means that some policies that q-learning might form against particular opponents may not work as well against others
