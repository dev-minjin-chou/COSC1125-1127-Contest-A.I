## Governing Strategy Tree  

### Application  
In Monte Carlo Simulation where all possible actions are recovered and weight in.The algorithm check whether the agent can return back to home
and if the reverse moves happens it breaks the algorithms and removes those movements. Once the agent see any ghost in the enemy region it immediately try to return back to the home after eating one dot on the other hand if the agent does not see any ghost when in the enemy base it head towards the dot and try to eat the maximum about of dots.
