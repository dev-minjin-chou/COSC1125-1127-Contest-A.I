## Future Improvements

An improvement for both agents would be if they could be fluid in their strategies. It's something that staff_team_super is excellent at, and one of the many reasons they've been so dominant in the leaderboards. Being able to analyse a situation and make a decision as to whether the agent should be defending their side of the board, or moving to the opponent's side to grab food is essential to overcoming some of the competition that was ranked highly towards the end of the semester. Fluidity would be more effective than statically deciding whether there should be one defense agent and one offense agent, or even just two offense agents. Also, if both agents can swap between an offensive and defensive strategy, then when an opponent eats a power pellet, both agents could simply make their way to the opponent's side to grab food, mostly negating the benefits the opponents gain from eating a power pellet.

An improvement for the defense agent in particular would be to recognise how beneficial its position is in relation to an opponent it is targeting. There are many examples of the defense agent just giving chase to an opponent, which even if it optimally chooses the right path, is never going to result in catching an opponent if the opponent is also able to outmaneuver it, or if there is a loop in the path that allows the opponent to just move in one direction and kite the defense agent until it makes it back to its territory safely. If the defense agent could see these loops in its future path, it would have the ability to wait at the border to have a better chance of capturing the opponent.

An improvement for the offense agent would be if they could use power pellets as an offensive tool. It was great at being able to protect itself from being captured by using the power pellets, but if it was able to strategically use the pellets so that it could completely ignore any ghosts nearby for the first half of the power pellets effectiveness, then it could delve deep into enemy territory, grab food, and then go on the offensive on the way back by eating ghosts that are near it. This would increase the amount of food that could be returned, and would be a much deadlier use of the power pellets.

## Conclusions and Learning
Our agent that we developed over the past few weeks was able to perform well in the daily competitions towards the end, which shows that constant iteration over the code we developed and constant feedback from the competitions was paramount to the success of the agents. Reviewing matches between pacman teams taught us about other students' techniques and thought process when it comes to designing AI, and proved that techniques that are vastly different can produce similar results, which also explains the large number of ties over the course of the competition. Overall, a lot of improvements can still be made to our agent, which I'm sure is the case for all the other pacman teams in the competition. If that wasn't the case, then staff_team_super wouldn't still be the leader at the end of this project. However, the agent we finished with still works quite well, and helped us consolidate techniques that have been discussed during the course.
