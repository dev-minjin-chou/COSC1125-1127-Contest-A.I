You can include screenshots of precompetition results and animated gifs, to showcase the evolution of your agents.

## First Agent Team - Heuristic Offensive and Defensive Agents
----

The first team composition we tried out were 2 heuristic agents that used expectimax adversarial search. One agent was tasked with travelling to the opponent's end of the board and collecting food, the other was tasked with standing guard at the border of our end of the board, and chasing down enemy agents that made it past the border.
